# Day 14: Coffee Machine Project

This project contains a coffee machine simulation for Day 14 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Using dictionaries to store menu items and resources
- Defining and calling functions for different machine operations
- Handling user input for drink selection and coin insertion
- Implementing loops and conditionals for program flow
- Managing resources and checking for sufficient ingredients

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Simulates a coffee machine that serves espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- Prompts the user to select a drink and insert coins.
- Checks if there are enough resources to make the selected drink.
- Updates resources and provides feedback after each transaction.
- Allows the user to turn off the machine or print a report of resources.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as functions, dictionaries, loops, and input handling by
