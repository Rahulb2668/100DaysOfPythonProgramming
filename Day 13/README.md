# Day 13: Higher Lower Game

This project contains a Higher Lower game for Day 13 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py & game_data.py

The game demonstrates:

- Using lists and dictionaries to store and manage data
- Importing data from external files
- Randomly selecting items for comparison
- Handling user input and validating guesses
- Implementing game logic with loops and conditionals
- Tracking and displaying the user's score

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Randomly selects two public figures or brands from a dataset.
- Prompts the user to guess which has more followers.
- Increases the score for each correct guess and continues the game.
- Ends the game when the user makes an incorrect guess and displays the final score.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as data structures, randomization, and control flow by building an interactive
