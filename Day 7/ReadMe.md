# Day 7: Hangman Game

This project contains a simple Hangman game for Day 7 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Using lists and strings to manage game state
- Reading user input
- Implementing loops and conditional statements
- Displaying ASCII art for game progress
- Tracking guessed letters and remaining lives

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Randomly selects a word for the player to guess.
- Prompts the user to guess letters one at a time.
- Updates and displays the current state of the word and remaining lives.
- Ends the game when the word is guessed or lives run out.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, and list manipulation by building an interactive game.
