# Day 15: OOP Coffee Machine Project

This project contains an object-oriented coffee machine simulation for Day 15 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Using classes and objects to structure code
- Importing and utilizing custom modules (`Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`)
- Handling user input for drink selection and machine operations
- Implementing loops and conditionals for program flow
- Managing resources and money transactions

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Ensure `menu.py`, `coffee_maker.py`, and `money_machine.py` are in the same directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Simulates a coffee machine that serves drinks from a menu.
- Prompts the user to select a drink, view reports, or turn off the machine.
- Checks resources and processes payments before making coffee.
- Updates resources and money after each transaction.

## Purpose

Practice object-oriented programming in Python by refactoring a procedural coffee machine into a modular, class-based project.
