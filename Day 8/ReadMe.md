# Day 8: Caesar Cipher

This project contains a Caesar Cipher encoder/decoder for Day 8 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Defining and calling functions
- Using lists and string manipulation
- Handling user input and validating characters
- Implementing encryption and decryption logic
- Using loops and conditionals for program flow

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Prompts the user to choose between encoding or decoding a message.
- Asks for the message and shift number.
- Applies the Caesar Cipher to encrypt or decrypt the message.
- Handles non-alphabetic characters by leaving them unchanged.
- Allows the user to restart or exit the program.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as functions, loops, and string manipulation by building a classic cipher
