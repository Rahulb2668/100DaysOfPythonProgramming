# Day 3: Treasure Island

This project contains a simple text-based adventure game called "Treasure Island" for Day 3 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Printing ASCII art and messages to the console
- Reading user input
- Using `.lower()` for input normalization
- Implementing nested conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Creating a branching storyline based on user choices

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Welcomes the player and sets the adventure scene.
- Prompts the user to make choices at key points in the story (crossroad, lake, doors).
- Leads the player through different outcomes based on their decisions.
- The goal is to find the treasure; incorrect choices end the game.

## Purpose

Practice fundamental Python skills, including input handling and control flow, while building
