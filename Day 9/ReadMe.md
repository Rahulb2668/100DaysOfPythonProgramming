# Day 9: Silent Auction Program

This project contains a silent auction script for Day 9 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Using dictionaries to store bidder names and bids
- Defining and calling functions to find the highest bidder
- Reading user input and converting types
- Implementing loops and conditional statements
- Clearing the console for privacy between bids

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

- Prompts users to enter their name and bid amount.
- Stores each bid in a dictionary.
- Asks if there are more bidders and clears the screen for privacy.
- Determines and announces the highest bidder when bidding ends.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as dictionaries, functions, loops, and input handling by building an interactive
