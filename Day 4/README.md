This project contains a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game for Day 4 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Printing ASCII art to the console
- Reading user input
- Using lists to store choices
- Generating random numbers with the `random` module
- Implementing game logic with conditional statements
- Displaying results based on user and computer choices

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Prompts the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Randomly selects the computer's choice.
