# Day 5: PyPassword Generator

This project contains a password generator script for Day 5 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Reading user input
- Using lists to store letters, numbers, and symbols
- Generating random choices with the `random` module
- Building strings with loops
- Shuffling lists to randomize password order
- Printing results to the console

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Prompts the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers for the password.
- Generates an "easy" password (ordered by character type).
- Generates an "advanced" password (characters shuffled for extra randomness).
- Prints both versions to the console.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as loops, randomization, and string manipulation by building a
