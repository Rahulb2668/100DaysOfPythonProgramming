# Day 12: Number Guessing Game

This project contains a number guessing game for Day 12 of the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.

## main.py

The `main.py` file demonstrates:

- Defining and calling functions
- Using variables and constants for game settings
- Handling user input and validating guesses
- Implementing game logic with loops and conditionals
- Providing feedback based on user guesses

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## What It Does

- Prompts the user to choose a difficulty mode (easy or hard).
- Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- Allows the user to guess the number, providing feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
- Tracks the number of remaining attempts based on the chosen difficulty.
- Announces when the user wins or loses.

## Purpose

Practice Python fundamentals such as functions, loops, conditionals, and input handling by building an
